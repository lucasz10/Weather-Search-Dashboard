GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

The application when loaded allows the user to input a city into the search field and get current weather information as well as an upcoming 
5 day Forecast. The application will also story the user's recent history into their local storage to call on updated information.
